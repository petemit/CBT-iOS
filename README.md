# CBT

This app is a work in progress. 


This is a simple Cognitive Behavioral Therapy questionnaire that I hope to be intuitive and simple to use.  

The feature set I'm aiming for:
* A questionnaire prompting the user to explain a difficult situation and allowing the user to complete a CBT exercise, including identifying cognitive distortions and thoughts and emotions
* Allowing the user to compare previous responses for convenience
* A summary page that shows the before and after emotions and thoughts for a particular log
* The option to store logs locally on device and be able to retrieve them as desired 
 
 
This is my first iOS app. I wanted to use this project as a way to push myself and learn the platform.
